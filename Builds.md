# Building Releases and Milestones

1. Tag the current `main` branch locally.  
`git tag v2.31.0.M3` or `git tag v2.31.0`

1. Run the Full Deploy Job
   * For milestones run the [xtext-monorepo-full-deploy-milestone](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/xtext-monorepo-full-deploy-milestone/) job and select the milestone postfix (M1, M2, ...) as the `RELEASE_TYPE` parameter.
   * For releases run the [xtext-monorepo-full-deploy-release](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/xtext-monorepo-full-deploy-release/) Job.

1. Wait for the job to finish  
Check the Update Site and Drop dirs to contain the new Milestone or Release
   * For milestones https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/milestones/ and https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/downloads/drops/
   * For releases https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/releases/ and https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/downloads/drops/

1. Promote staged milestone/release on [s01.oss.sonatype.org](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/). Can only be done by Xtext release engineer with the right credentials at sonatype
   * Log in with your sonatype user.
